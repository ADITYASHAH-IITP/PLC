# PLC
Learn Logic behind building circuit for Pneumatic and Hydraulic system.
<b>Aim of the Experiments.<br></b>
a) Perform simple expansion and retraction of a double acting cylinder.<br>
b) Expand two double acting cylinders, one after other and after expansion, retract both cylinders simultaneously.<br>
c) Design a pneumatic circuit to bond two components together with a defining force for 5 seconds.<br><br><br>
<b><br>Pre-Requisites/Components Required<br></b>
In the Simulation Implementation I have used the following Software:<br>
â€¢ CODESYS V3.5 SP17<br>

<br><br>
<b>Additional Read:<br></b>
i. Explain process for sending the ladder to the hardware<br>
ii. What is the role of timer.<br>
iii. What is latching in PLCs. Explain with a simple latching circuit figure.<br>
